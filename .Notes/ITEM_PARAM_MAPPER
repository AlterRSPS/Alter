For some reason only could find on Khopesh:
2059->A powerful Khopesh, imbued with the power of thunder and lightning.<br><br>Deals full damage to the Corporeal Beast<br>Has a 20% chance to trigger a AoE lightning bolt under the target, hitting anything in a 1 tile radius, which rolls with 50% of the original attacks max hit.
2060->50% - Attacks twice. If either attack is successful an additional lightning bolt is summoned rolling up to 100% of the original attacks max hit.
