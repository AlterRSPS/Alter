1) Examine ground_item not working // Missing Oploc6
3) Interfaces
4) Public Chat
5) NPC Face pawn mask
6) MapAnim (Need to use the new one not the legacy one)
7) When you buy out item from shop -> It dissapears (Should place a temp placeholder with 0x Amount)
8) Bank tab not working
9) Dunno what happens but when have worldmap open -> And you click on random spots -> it will teleport you to wrong cords, if you hold Shift - Click it teleports into the clicked spot .


Add:
When pulling out item from bank => That has no note id, make that it would output "This item cannot be withdrawn as a note." / Does not matter wut it is.
+ Note: It will also output first that it can't be noted before writing that he has no space in inventory.
