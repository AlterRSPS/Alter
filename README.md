[![revision: 231][rev-badge]][patch] [![Discord](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/discord?icon=discord&label)](https://discord.com/invite/sAzCuuwkpN) ![jdk-badge] ![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/AlterRSPS/Alter)

**Alter** is a modified version of [RSMod](https://github.com/Tomm0017/rsmod) a highly flexible user-friendly game server for use with the OSRS client. Implemented in a modular way,
the framework allows developers to make and create any sort of plugin they wish without having to modify the core game module.
Due to the plugin capabilities, even owners without programming experience can just have others make plugins for them and simply drop them into the plugins module to be automatically loaded on the next startup!
#### I found a bug, where can I report it?

#  Server setup
* Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tu-NTzMbf0

* ### First of all Download:
* [Xteas](https://archive.openrs2.org/caches/runescape/2038/keys.json) Save as `xteas.json` inside `/data/` Directory.
* [cache-oldschool-live-en-b231-2025-06-11-10-45-05-openrs2](https://archive.openrs2.org/caches/runescape/2206/disk.zip) , And make sure you're using correct Java Version.
* Also make sure you have [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) installed, how to install intellij: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8T5Qwa5d_o)

* First open Intellij, (If you already have a project open, either do `File -> Close`, or `File -> New -> Project from Version Control`)
* If you decided to use `Close method` you will see this window, click on `Get from VCS`
  ![tutor1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/tutor1.png)
* Second paste `https://github.com/AlterRSPS/Alter` in URL Field and hit Clone. </br>
  ![tutor2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/tuor2.png)
* Hit `Clone` and Let the project fully load.
* Now open the `cache-oldschool-live-en-b231-2025-06-11-10-45-05-openrs2` file that you downloaded. and drag out Xteas.json and Cache folder and pull it to `/Data/` Folder.
  ![tutor6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/tutor6.png)
- `Xtea.json` has to be in same folder like: Data /`api.yml`, etc..
* Now click on `Gradle` button on right side. </br>
  ![tutor4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/Tutor4.png)
* Expand `Alter` -> `other` and double click `install`
  ![tutor5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/Tutori5.png)
* And now wait until you get this result in your `Terminal` at the bottom:
  ![tutor7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/tutor7.png)
* Now instead of `Install` task do Run `Gradle -> Alter -> game -> Tasks -> Application - Run`
* Now the server should be running, you should see inside your terminal:
  ![tutor8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_Alter/Alter_Successfully_initialized.png)
* If you only see `Alter Loaded up in x ms.` you messed up somewhere.
* You can connect what ever client you want (ofc it has to follow OSRS protocols.)

> [!NOTE]
> When you have Intellij Open, navigate to `File` -> `Project Structure` -> And make sure SDK is set to `17 java version 17.x.x`
> 
> It is also recommended to install the [rscm-plugin](https://github.com/blurite/rscm-plugin) in IntelliJ for enhanced Entity references support. 
# Client setup:
> [!TIP]  
> As for now, [RSProx](https://github.com/blurite/rsprox/releases) is the only OSRS client that should be used. It's developed by the most trusted and experienced developers in the RSPS scene.
> 
> For Windows users: Just press `âŠž + R` and in text field area write: `%USERPROFILE%` and locate folder named `.rsprox` create a new file named: `proxy-targets.yaml` and inside paste:  
>  
> ```yaml  
> config:  
>   - id: 1  
>     name: Alter  
>     jav_config_url: https://client.blurite.io/jav_local_231.ws  
>     varp_count: 15000  
>     revision: 231.1  
>     modulus: YOUR_MODULUS_KEY_HERE  
> ```  
> Modulus key will be found inside Alter Project root directory make sure to copy every character, And replace `YOUR_MODULUS_KEY_HERE` inside `proxy-targets.yaml` with your modulus key. For more information on it you can find at: [RSProx-Private-Server-Usage](https://github.com/blurite/rsprox?tab=readme-ov-file#private-server-usage)
> 
> If you haven't used RSProx before, You won't have `.rsprox` folder inside `%USERPROFILE%`

> [!WARNING]
> And stay away from client's like Devious, as they have been caught adding Account Stealer into their client.
