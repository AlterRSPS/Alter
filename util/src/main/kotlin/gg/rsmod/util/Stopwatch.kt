/**
 * An object that accurately measures *elapsed time*: the measured duration between two
 * successive readings of "now" in the same process.
 *
 *
 * In contrast, *wall time* is a reading of "now" as given by a method like
 * [System.currentTimeMillis], best represented as an [java.time.Instant]. Such values
 * *can* be subtracted to obtain a `Duration` (such as by `Duration.between`), but
 * doing so does *not* give a reliable measurement of elapsed time, because wall time readings
 * are inherently approximate, routinely affected by periodic clock corrections. Because this class
 * uses [System.nanoTime], it is unaffected by these changes.
 *
 *
 * Use this class instead of direct calls to [System.nanoTime] for the following reason:
 *
 *
 *  * The raw `long` values returned by `nanoTime` are meaningless and unsafe to use
 * in any other way than how `Stopwatch` uses them.
 *
 *
 *
 * The one downside of `Stopwatch` relative to [System.nanoTime] is that `Stopwatch` requires object allocation and additional method calls, which can reduce the accuracy
 * of the elapsed times reported. `Stopwatch` is still suitable for logging and metrics where
 * reasonably accurate values are sufficient. If the uncommon case that you need to maximize
 * accuracy, use `System.nanoTime()` directly instead.
 *
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * <pre>`Stopwatch stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();
 * doSomething();
 * stopwatch.stop(); // optional
 *
 * Duration duration = stopwatch.elapsed();
 *
 * log.info("time: " + stopwatch); // formatted string like "12.3 ms"
`</pre> *
 *
 *
 * The state-changing methods are not idempotent; it is an error to start or stop a stopwatch
 * that is already in the desired state.
 *
 *
 * **Note:** This class is not thread-safe.
