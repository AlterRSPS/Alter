Uri transform
Uri transform is a more complicated emote, it consists of 2x transform to NPC, 4x GFX, and 3x animations that all need to be timed correctly.

Tick 1: GFX 86 (high GFX) and transform to NPC 7311.

Tick 2: GFX 1306, anim 7278, and transform to NPC 7313

Tick 12: Anim 4069

Tick 13: GFX 678 and anim 4071

Tick 15: GFX 86 (high), reset animation (65535), transform back to player

While running an event for this, keep checking for if the player does an interrupting action like walking, and if so cancel the rest of the event, play GFX -1, reset animation, and transform back to player.
